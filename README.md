# Find me a master

Some considerations before running:

Due to the short time, the project was kept simple: no use of routes or Redux and no tests were written.

You can find this project on [Github](https://github.com/fabiolenzi/amcom-jedi-masters).


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run the project

In the project directory, before running the app, install all dependencies with:

### `npm install`

Then you can run the app with:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To generate a build folder, run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Or you can run the build locally with:

### `npx serve -s build`

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the build in the browser.
